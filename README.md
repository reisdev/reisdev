## Career

This topic describes my career, company by company.

### [No Bugs](https://nobugs.com.br) - from 2016 to 2018

My career started at this junior company, as a Project Manager, and I had to manage a few projects of websites development. One and a half year later, I got elected to be the Project Director, which was my role for a year. I managed many development projects, such as websites, mobile and desktop applications. I had to lead a team of 10 people and coordinate the workflow, collect updates of each of them and, eventually, get in contact with our clients to solve some bigger problem.
